## OpenMP Course Exercises Solutions

Solutions to the exercises found in OpenMP introductory slides from N. Trifonidis,
used during the OpenMP course in MSc Computational Physics at AUTh,
and the exercises set given by N. Stergioulas.

**TODO**: Add Fortran versions

**TODO**: Solve and add 2019 homework set

The slides are available in [[1]], [[2]] (written in Greek).
Also, N. Stergioulas [has a repo][niksterg-openmp-course] with some example programs that introduce OpenMP concepts.
